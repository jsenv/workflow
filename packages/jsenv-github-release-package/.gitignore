# Files inside ".jsenv" directory are dynamically generated by jsenv.
# It's a filesystem cache of dynamically generated files.
# -> do not track transient files generated dynamically
/.jsenv/

# Files inside "coverage" directory are generated by "npm run test-with-coverage"
# These files are generated dynamically and meant to be viewed locally
# -> do not track coverage files (feel free to track them if you want)
/coverage/

# Files inside "node_modules" directory are generated by "npm install"
# These files are fetched dynamically by npm and very big
# -> do not track node module files
/node_modules/

# importmap generated by "npm run generate-importmap" is dependent
# of "node_modules" directory content.
# "node_modules" directory content might change often and be non deterministic,
# especially after npm install without using "package-lock.json".
# As this file is generated dynamically and might have non deterministic content
# due to its dependency to "node_modules" it's simpler not to track it.
# -> do not track "node_resolution.importmap"
/node_resolution.importmap

# jsconfig.json is generated by "npm run generate-importmap". jsconfig.json
# tells VSCode where are the files until it natively support import maps.
# -> no need to track a file generated dynamically
/jsconfig.json
